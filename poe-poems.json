    "Alone" : "From childhood’s hour I have not been <br>
    As others were—I have not seen <br>
    As others saw—I could not bring <br>
    My passions from a common spring— <br>
    From the same source I have not taken <br>
    My sorrow—I could not awaken <br>
    My heart to joy at the same tone— <br>
    And all I lov’d—I lov’d alone— <br>
    Then—in my childhood—in the dawn <br>
    Of a most stormy life—was drawn <br>
    From ev’ry depth of good and ill <br>
    The mystery which binds me still— <br>
    From the torrent, or the fountain— <br>
    From the red cliff of the mountain— <br>
    From the sun that ’round me roll’d <br>
    In its autumn tint of gold— <br>
    From the lightning in the sky <br>
    As it pass’d me flying by— <br>
    From the thunder, and the storm— <br>
    And the cloud that took the form <br>
    (When the rest of Heaven was blue) <br>
    Of a demon in my view—",
    "Al Aaraaf" :  "Part I. <br>
    <br>
    O! NOTHING earthly save the ray <br>
    [Thrown back from flowers] of Beauty's eye, <br>
    As in those gardens where the day <br>
    Springs from the gems of Circassy — <br>
    O! nothing earthly save the thrill <br>
    Of melody in woodland rill — <br>
    Or [music of the passion-hearted] <br>
    Joy's voice so peacefully departed <br>
    That like the murmur in the shell, <br>
    Its echo dwelleth and will dwell — <br>
    With nothing of the dross of ours — <br>
    Yet all the beauty — all the flowers <br>
    That list our Love, and deck our bowers <br>
    Adorn yon world afar, afar — <br>
    The wandering star — <br>
    'Twas a sweet time for Nesace — for there <br>
    Her world lay lolling on the golden air, <br>
    Near four bright suns — a temporary rest — <br>
    A garden-spot in desert of the blest. <br>
    <br>
    Away — away — mid [['mid]] seas of rays that roll <br>
    Empyrean splendor o'er th' unchained soul — <br>
    The soul that scarce [the billows are so dense] <br>
    Can struggle to its destin'd eminence — <br>
    To distant spheres, from time to time, she rode, <br>
    And late to ours, the favour'd one of God — <br>
    But, now, the ruler of an anchor'd realm, <br>
    She throws aside the sceptre — leaves the helm, <br>
    And, amid incense, and high spiritual hymns, <br>
    Laves in quadruple light her angel limbs. <br>
    <br>
    Now happiest, loveliest in yon lovely Earth, <br>
    Whence sprang the “Idea of Beauty” into birth. <br>
    [Falling in wreaths thro' many a startled star, <br>
    Like woman's hair 'mid pearls, until, afar, <br>
    It lit on hills Archaian, and there dwelt] <br>
    She look'd into Infinity — and knelt. <br>
    Rich clouds, for canopies, about her curled — <br>
    Fit emblems of the model of her world — <br>
    Seen but in beauty — not impeding sight <br>
    Of other beauty glittering thro' the light — <br>
    A wreath that twined each starry form around, <br>
    And all the opal'd air in colour bound. <br>
    <br>
    All hurriedly she knelt upon a bed <br>
    Of flowers: of lilies such as rear the head <br>
    On the fair Capo Deucato, and sprang <br>
    So eagerly around about to hang <br>
    Upon the flying footsteps of —— deep pride — <br>
    Of her who lov'd a mortal — and so died — <br>
    The Sephalica, budding with young bees, <br>
    Uprear'd its purple stem around her knees — <br>
    And gemmy flower, of Trebizond misnamed — <br>
    Inmate of highest stars, where erst it sham'd <br>
    All other loveliness: its honied dew <br>
    [The fabled nectar that the heathen knew] <br>
    Deliriously sweet, was dropp'd from Heaven, <br>
    And fell on gardens of the unforgiven <br>
    In Trebizond — and on a sunny flower <br>
    So like its own above that, to this hour, <br>
    It still remaineth torturing the bee <br>
    With madness, and unwonted reverie — <br>
    In Heaven, and all its environs, the leaf <br>
    And blossom of the fairy plant, in grief <br>
    Disconsolate linger — grief that hangs her head, <br>
    Repenting follies that full long have fled, <br>
    Heaving her white breast to the balmy air <br>
    Like guilty beauty, chasten'd, and more fair — <br>
    Nyctanthes too, as sacred as the light <br>
    She fears to perfume, perfuming the night — <br>
    And Clytia pondering between many a sun, <br>
    While pettish tears adown her petals run — <br>
    And that aspiring flower that sprang on Earth — <br>
    And died, ere scarce exalted into birth, <br>
    Bursting its odorous heart in spirit to wing <br>
    Its way to Heaven, from garden of a king — <br>
    And Valisnerian lotus thither flown <br>
    From struggling with the waters of the Rhone — <br>
    And thy most lovely purple perfume, Zante! <br>
    I sola d'oro! — Fior di Levante! — <br>
    And the Nelumbo bud that floats for ever <br>
    With Indian Cupid down the holy river — <br>
    Fair flowers, and fairy! to whose care is given <br>
    To bear the Goddess' song, in odours, up to Heaven — <br>
    <br>
    “Spirit! that dwellest where, <br>
    In the deep sky, <br>
    The terrible and fair, <br>
    In beauty vie! <br>
    Beyond the line of blue — <br>
    The boundary of the star <br>
    Which turneth at the view <br>
    Of thy barrier and thy bar — <br>
    Of the barrier overgone <br>
    By the comets who were cast <br>
    From their pride, and from their throne <br>
    To be drudges till the last — <br>
    To be carriers of fire <br>
    [The red fire of their heart] <br>
    With speed that may not tire <br>
    And with pain that shall not part — <br>
    Who livest — that we know <br>
    In Eternity — we feel — <br>
    But the shadow of whose brow <br>
    What spirit shall reveal? <br>
    Tho' the beings whom thy Nesace, <br>
    Thy messenger hath known <br>
    Have dream'd for thy Infinity <br>
    A model of their own — <br>
    Thy will is done, O! God! <br>
    The star hath ridden high <br>
    Thro' many a tempest, but she rode <br>
    Beneath thy burning eye <br>
    And here, in thought, to thee — <br>
    In thought that can alone <br>
    Ascend thy empire and so be <br>
    A partner of thy throne <br>
    By winged Fantasy, <br>
    My embassy is given <br>
    Till secrecy shall knowledge be <br>
    In the environs of Heaven.” <br>
    <br>
    She ceas'd — and buried then her burning cheek <br>
    Abash'd, amid the lilies there, to seek <br>
    A shelter from the fervor of his eye <br>
    For the stars trembled at the Deity. <br>
    She stirr'd not — breath'd not — for a voice was there <br>
    How solemnly pervading the calm air <br>
    A sound of silence on the startled ear <br>
    Which dreamy poets name “the music of the sphere.” <br>
    Ours is a world of words: Quiet we call <br>
    “Silence” — which is the merest word of all — <br>
    Here Nature speaks, and ev'n ideal things <br>
    Flap shadowy sounds from visionary wings — <br>
    But ah! not so when, thus, in realms on high <br>
    The eternal voice of God is passing by, <br>
    And the red winds are withering in the sky! <br>
    “What tho' in worlds which sightless Cycles run <br>
    Link'd to a little system, and one sun <br>
    Where all my love is folly and the crowd <br>
    Still think my terrors but the thunder cloud <br>
    The storm, the earthquake, and the ocean-wrath — <br>
    [Ah! will they cross me in my angrier path?] <br>
    What tho' in worlds which own a single sun <br>
    The sands of Time grow dimmer as they run <br>
    Yet thine is my resplendency, so given <br>
    To bear my secrets thro' the upper Heaven: <br>
    Leave tenantless thy chrystal home, and fly, <br>
    With all thy train, athwart the moony sky — <br>
    Apart — like fire-flies in Sicilian night, <br>
    And wing to other worlds another light; <br>
    Divulge the secrets of thy embassy <br>
    To the proud orbs that twinkle — and so be <br>
    To ev'ry heart a barrier and a ban <br>
    Lest the stars totter in the guilt of man.” <br>
    <br>
    Up rose the maiden in the yellow night, <br>
    The single-mooned eve! on Earth we plight <br>
    Our faith to one love — and one moon adore — <br>
    The birth-place of young Beauty had no more. <br>
    As sprang that yellow star from downy hours <br>
    Up rose the maiden from her shrine of flowers, <br>
    And bent o'er sheeny mountain and dim plain <br>
    Her way — but left not yet her Therasæan reign. <br>
    <br>
    Part II. <br>
    <br>
    HIGH on a mountain of enamell'd head — <br>
    Such as the drowsy shepherd on his bed <br>
    Of giant pasturage lying at his ease, <br>
    Raising his heavy eyelid, starts and sees <br>
    With many a mutter'd “hope to be forgiven” <br>
    What time the moon is quadrated in Heaven — <br>
    Of rosy head that, towering far away <br>
    Into the sunlit ether, caught the ray <br>
    Of sunken suns at eve — at noon of night, <br>
    While the moon danc'd with the fair stranger light — <br>
    Uprear'd upon such height arose a pile <br>
    Of gorgeous columns on th' unburthen'd air, <br>
    Flashing from Parian marble that twin smile <br>
    Far down upon the wave that sparkled there, <br>
    And nursled the young mountain in its lair: <br>
    Of molten stars their pavement, such as fall <br>
    Thro' the ebon air, besilvering the pall <br>
    Of their own dissolution, while they die — <br>
    Adorning then the dwellings of the sky: <br>
    A dome, by linked light from Heaven let down, <br>
    Sat gently on these columns as a crown — <br>
    A window of one circular diamond, there, <br>
    Look'd out above into the purple air, <br>
    And rays from God shot down that meteor chain <br>
    And hallow'd all the beauty twice again, <br>
    Save when, between th' Empyrean and that ring, <br>
    Some eager spirit flapp'd his dusky wing: <br>
    But on the pillars Seraph eyes have seen <br>
    The dimness of this world: that greyish green <br>
    That Nature loves the best for Beauty's grave <br>
    Lurk'd in each cornice, round each architrave — <br>
    And ev'ry sculptur'd cherub thereabout <br>
    That, from his marble dwelling ventur'd out <br>
    Seem'd earthly in the shallow of his niche — <br>
    Archaian statues in a world so rich? <br>
    Friezes from Tadmor and Persepolis — <br>
    From Balbec, and the stilly, clear abyss <br>
    Of beautiful Gomorrah! O! the wave <br>
    Is now upon thee — but too late to save! — <br>
    <br>
    Sound loves to revel near a summer night: <br>
    Witness the murmur of the grey twilight <br>
    That stole upon the ear, in Eyraco, <br>
    Of many a wild star-gazer long ago — <br>
    That stealeth ever on the ear of him <br>
    Who, musing, gazeth on the distance dim, <br>
    And sees the darkness coming as a cloud — <br>
    Is not its form — its voice — most palpable and loud? <br>
    <br>
    But what is this? — it cometh — and it brings <br>
    A music with it — 'tis the rush of wings — <br>
    A pause — and then a sweeping, falling strain <br>
    And Nesace is in her halls again: <br>
    From the wild energy of wanton haste <br>
    Her cheek was flushing, and her lips apart; <br>
    And zone that clung around her gentle waist <br>
    <br>
    Had burst beneath the heaving of her heart: <br>
    Within the centre of that hall to breathe <br>
    She paus'd and panted, Zanthe! all beneath — <br>
    The fairy light that kiss'd her golden hair <br>
    And long'd to rest, yet could but sparkle there! <br>
    <br>
    Young flowers were whispering in melody <br>
    To happy flowers that night — and tree to tree; <br>
    Fountains were gushing music as they fell <br>
    In many a star-lit grove, or moon-lit dell; <br>
    Yet silence came upon material things — <br>
    Fair flowers, bright waterfalls and angel wings — <br>
    And sound alone that from the spirit sprang <br>
    Bore burthen to the charm the maiden sang. <br>
    <br>
    “'Neath blue-bell or streamer — <br>
    Or tufted wild spray <br>
    That keeps, from the dreamer, <br>
    The moonbeam away — <br>
    Bright beings! that ponder, <br>
    With half closing eyes, <br>
    On the stars which your wonder <br>
    Hath drawn from the skies, <br>
    Till they glance thro' the shade, and <br>
    Come down to your brow <br>
    Like —— eyes of the maiden <br>
    Who calls on you now — <br>
    Arise! from your dreaming <br>
    In violet bowers, <br>
    To duty beseeming <br>
    These star-litten hours — <br>
    And shake from your tresses <br>
    Encumber'd with dew <br>
    The breath of those kisses <br>
    That cumber them too — <br>
    [O! how, without you, Love! <br>
    Could angels be blest]? <br>
    Those kisses of true love <br>
    That lull'd ye to rest: <br>
    Up! — shake from your wing <br>
    Each hindering thing: <br>
    The dew of the night — <br>
    It would weigh down your flight; <br>
    And true love caresses — <br>
    O! leave them apart, <br>
    They are light on the tresses, <br>
    But hang on the heart. <br>
    <br>
    Ligeia! Ligeia! <br>
    My beautiful one! <br>
    Whose harshest idea <br>
    Will to melody run, <br>
    O! is it thy will <br>
    On the breezes to toss? <br>
    Or, capriciously still, <br>
    Like the lone Albatross, <br>
    Incumbent on night <br>
    [As she on the air] <br>
    To keep watch with delight <br>
    On the harmony there? <br>
    <br>
    Ligeia! wherever <br>
    Thy image may be <br>
    No magic shall sever <br>
    Thy music from thee: <br>
    Thou hast bound many eyes <br>
    In a dreamy sleep — <br>
    But the strains still arise <br>
    Which thy vigilance keep — <br>
    The sound of the rain <br>
    Which leaps down to the flower, <br>
    And dances again <br>
    In the rhythm of the shower — <br>
    The murmur that springs <br>
    From the growing of grass <br>
    Are the music of things — <br>
    But are modell'd, alas! — <br>
    Away, then my dearest, <br>
    O! hie thee away <br>
    To springs that lie clearest <br>
    Beneath the moon ray — <br>
    To lone lake that smiles, <br>
    In its dream of deep rest, <br>
    At the many star-isles <br>
    That enjewel its breast — <br>
    Where wild flowers, creeping, <br>
    Have mingled their shade, <br>
    On its margin is sleeping <br>
    Full many a maid — <br>
    Some have left the cool glade, and <br>
    Have slept with the bee — <br>
    Arouse them my maiden, <br>
    On moorland and lea — <br>
    Go! breathe on their slumber, <br>
    All softly in ear, <br>
    The musical number <br>
    They slumber'd to hear — <br>
    For what can awaken <br>
    An angel so soon <br>
    Whose sleep hath been taken <br>
    Beneath the cold moon <br>
    As the spell which no slumber <br>
    Of witchery may test, <br>
    The rythmical number <br>
    Which lull'd him to rest?” <br>
    <br>
    Spirits in wing, and angels to the view, <br>
    A thousand seraphs burst th' Empyrean thro', <br>
    Young dreams still hovering on their drowsy flight — <br>
    Seraphs in all but “Knowledge,” the keen light <br>
    That fell, refracted, thro' thy bounds, afar <br>
    O! Death! from eye of God upon that star: <br>
    Sweet was that error — sweeter still that death — <br>
    Sweet was that error — ev'n with us the breath <br>
    Of science dims the mirror of our joy — <br>
    To them 'twere the Simoom, and would destroy — <br>
    For what [to them] availeth it to know <br>
    That Truth is Falsehood — or that Bliss is Woe? <br>
    Sweet was their death — with them to die was rife <br>
    With the last extacy of satiate life — <br>
    Beyond that death no immortality — <br>
    But sleep that pondereth and is not “to be” — <br>
    And there — oh! may my weary spirit dwell — <br>
    Apart from Heaven's Eternity — and yet how far from Hell! <br>
    What guilty spirit, in what shrubbery dim, <br>
    Heard not the stirring summons of that hymn? <br>
    But two: they fell: for Heaven no grace imparts <br>
    To those who hear not for their beating hearts. <br>
    A maiden-angel and her seraph-lover — <br>
    O! where (and ye may seek the wide skies over) <br>
    Was Love, the blind, near sober Duty known? <br>
    Unguided Love hath fallen — 'mid “tears of perfect moan:” <br>
    <br>
    He was a goodly spirit — he who fell: <br>
    A wanderer by mossy mantled well — <br>
    A gazer on the lights that shine above — <br>
    A dreamer in the moonbeam by his love: <br>
    What wonder? for each star is eye-like there, <br>
    And looks so sweetly down on Beauty's hair — <br>
    And they, and ev'ry mossy spring were holy <br>
    To his love haunted heart and melancholy. <br>
    The night had found (to him a night of wo) <br>
    Upon a mountain crag, young Angelo — <br>
    Beetling it bends athwart the solemn sky, <br>
    And scowls on starry worlds that down beneath it lie. <br>
    Here sate he with his love — his dark eye bent <br>
    With eagle gaze along the firmament: <br>
    Now turn'd it upon her — but ever then <br>
    It trembled to one constant star again. <br>
    “Ianthe, dearest, see! how dim that ray! <br>
    How lovely 'tis to look so far away! <br>
    She seem'd not thus upon that autumn eve <br>
    I left her gorgeous halls — nor mourn'd to leave: <br>
    That eve — that eve — I should remember well — <br>
    The sun-ray dropp'd, in Lemnos, with a spell <br>
    On th' ‘Arabesq’ carving of a gilded hall <br>
    Wherein I sate, and on the drapried wall — <br>
    And on my eye lids — O! the heavy light! <br>
    How drowsily it weigh'd them into night! <br>
    On flowers, before, and mist, and love they ran <br>
    With Persian Saadi in his Gulistan: <br>
    But O! that light! — I slumber'd — Death, the while, <br>
    Stole o'er my senses in that lovely isle <br>
    So softly that no single silken hair <br>
    Awoke that slept — or knew that it was there. <br>
    <br>
    The last spot of Earth's orb I trod upon <br>
    Was a proud temple call'd the Parthenon — <br>
    More beauty clung around her column'd wall <br>
    Than ev'n thy glowing bosom beats withal, <br>
    And when old Time my wing did disenthral <br>
    Thence sprang I — as the eagle from his tower, <br>
    And years I left behind me in an hour. <br>
    What time upon her airy bounds I hung <br>
    One half the garden of her globe was flung <br>
    Unrolling as a chart unto my view — <br>
    Tenantless cities of the desert too! <br>
    Ianthe, beauty crowded on me then, <br>
    And half I wish'd to be again of men. <br>
    <br>
    “My Angelo! and why of them to be? <br>
    A brighter dwelling-place is here for thee — <br>
    And greener fields than in yon world above, <br>
    And women's loveliness — and passionate love. <br>
    <br>
    “But, list, Ianthe! when the air so soft <br>
    Fail'd, as my pennon'd spirit leapt aloft, <br>
    Perhaps my brain grew dizzy — but the world <br>
    I left so late was into chaos hurl'd — <br>
    Sprang from her station, on the winds apart, <br>
    And roll'd, a flame, the fiery Heaven athwart. <br>
    Methought, my sweet one, then I ceas'd to soar <br>
    And fell — not swiftly as I rose before, <br>
    But with a downward, tremulous motion thro' <br>
    Light, brazen rays, this golden star unto! <br>
    Nor long the measure of my falling hours, <br>
    For nearest of all stars was thine to ours — <br>
    Dread star! that came, amid a night of mirth, <br>
    A red Dædalion on the timid Earth! <br>
    “We came — and to thy Earth — but not to us <br>
    Be given our lady's bidding to discuss: <br>
    We came, my love; around, above, below, <br>
    Gay fire-fly of the night we come and go, <br>
    Nor ask a reason save the angel-nod <br>
    She grants to us, as granted by her God  <br>
    But, Angelo, than thine grey Time unfurl'd <br>
    Never his fairy wing o'er fairier world! <br>
    Dim was its little disk, and angel eyes <br>
    Alone could see the phantom in the skies, <br>
    When first Al Aaraaf knew her course to be <br>
    Headlong thitherward o'er the starry sea — <br>
    But when its glory swell'd upon the sky, <br>
    As glowing Beauty's bust beneath man's eye, <br>
    We paus'd before the heritage of men, <br>
    And thy star trembled — as doth Beauty then!” <br>
    Thus, in discourse, the lovers whiled away <br>
    The night that waned and waned and brought no day <br>
    They fell: for Heaven to them no hope imparts <br>
    Who hear not for the beating of their hearts. <br>",
